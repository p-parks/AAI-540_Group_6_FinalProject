# AAI-540: Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) Group 6 Course Project
## Email Spam Detection

## Project Background
The purpose of this project is to develop a machine learning model to classify email messages as either spam or legitimate emails. Spam detection is crucial for filtering out unwanted messages that can clutter inboxes and pose security risks. The primary objective of the model is to correctly identify spam emails while ensuring that legitimate emails are not incorrectly classified as spam.

This is a binary classification problem where the goal is to predict whether an email is spam (label 1) or ham (label 0) based on its content. The dataset is composed of a combination of two well-known datasets: the 2007 TREC Public Spam Corpus and the Enron-Spam Dataset. The challenge involves working with text data and building a robust model that can generalize well to unseen email messages.

## Technical Background
- **Dataset**: [Kaggle Dataset]([https://www.kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/purusinghvi/email-spam-classification-dataset))
- **Size**: Approximately 83,446 records.
- **NLP Techniques**: The classification of emails as spam or ham will rely heavily on natural language processing (NLP) techniques for text analysis and representation. Feature engineering can also be used to indicate special character usage or common spam keywords.


# Project Description

## Description
Throughout the AAI-540 course, you will develop and practice the framework, methodology, and skills for Machine Learning Operations (MLOps). As part of the course project, small teams (2-3 members) will apply their knowledge of MLOps to a real-world ML project scenario. Over the course of the program, your team will iteratively design and develop the key components of a production-ready machine learning system. MLOps concepts will be incorporated into each module, culminating in a final deliverable at the end of Module 7.

In this project, you will:
- Collaborate on designing and building an ML system.
- Create an **ML System Design Document** and codebase.
- Deliver a **video demonstration** of your system.

## Project Scenario
In the first module, your group will:
1. **Identify a problem space**: Research a hypothetical company and business goal to serve as the impetus for the ML solution.
2. **Formulate a machine learning problem**: Frame a problem that an ML system can solve, ensuring that your data source is adequate for the problem.
   - Minimum dataset requirement: 3-5 files, with at least 10,000 records per file. If it's a classification problem, each class should have at least 10,000 labeled records.

## Project Deliverables
Each module introduces new skills and knowledge that will guide your team toward completing the project. Stay on pace and complete steps as outlined to avoid last-minute rushes.

### Final Deliverables
1. **ML System Design Document** (Written Report)
2. **Video Presentation** (10-15 minutes with screencast and audio narration)
3. **GitHub Repository** (Codebase for your ML system)

## Project Timeline & Workflow
To manage your team workflows and project development:
- **Use Asana** to plan and track your project.
- Update your project board as new tasks and modules progress.
- Ensure steady progress and teamwork throughout each module.

### Examples of Previous Projects
An example from AAI-540 Spring 2024:
- Team Project: *Smart Meter Energy Prediction*

## Requirements
### Key Project Steps
1. **ML System Design Document**: 
   - A technical document for stakeholders, outlining the problem, solution, and system design.
   - Include detailed sections for:
     - Data Sources
     - Data Engineering
     - Feature Engineering
     - Model Training & Evaluation
     - Model Deployment
     - Model Monitoring
     - CI/CD Pipeline
   - Complete a **Security Checklist** to address sensitive data, bias, and ethical concerns.

2. **Video Demonstration**: 
   - Present the system operation, architecture, feature store, monitoring dashboards, model registry, and CI/CD.
   - Demonstrate SageMaker operations, inference jobs, and system monitoring in a 10-15 minute video.
   - Each member should contribute equally, and the video should be in **mp4 format**.

3. **GitHub Repository**: 
   - A clean and professional codebase that supports your system design document.
   - Include **S3-stored datasets** and visualizations (charts/graphs) as necessary.
   - Ensure team members contribute equally, and all code is well-documented and clean.

## Participation & Accountability
Equitable contributions and ongoing communication are essential. Teams will:
- Post **weekly project updates** using the teamwork tracker.
- Complete **peer evaluations** in Module 7.

## Late Policy
Assignments should be submitted by the due date. A 10% reduction will be applied for each day late, and assignments will not be accepted after 48 hours without prior discussion with the instructor.
