It seems there is a little typo in /debian/README file  Example: http://gulus.usherbrooke.ca/debian/README ftp://ftp.fr.debian.org/debian/README  \"Testing, or lenny.  Access this release through dists/testing.  The current tested development snapshot is named etch.  Packages which have been tested in unstable and passed automated tests propogate to this release.\"  etch should be replace by lenny like in the README.html    --  Yan Morin Consultant en logiciel libre yan.morin@savoirfairelinux.com 514-994-1556   --  To UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-mirrors-REQUEST@lists.debian.org with a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
